iOS In APP 상품 타입

Consumable(소모품): These can be bought more than once and can be used up. These are a good fit for extra lives, in-game currency, temporary power-ups, and the like

Non-Consumable(비소모품): Something that you buy once, and expect to have permanently such as extra levels and unlockable content. The RazeFace illustrations from this tutorial fall into this category

Non-Renewing Subscription(기간제 구독): Content that’s available for a fixed period of time
Auto-Renewing Subscription(자동 연장 구독): A repeating subscription such as a monthly raywenderlich.com subscription
