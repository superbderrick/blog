## Components of an Android Application

There are four different types of app components:

Activities
Services
Broadcast receivers
Content providers

1.Activity
- An activity is a class that represents a single screen

2.Service
- Service is a background process that can run for a long time

3.Broadcast receivers
- A broadcast receiver (receiver) is an Android component which allows you to register for system or application events
- ex) network connection / stop , sms , Change date

4.Content providers
- content provider is an application component which is responsible for the supply of the requested data from one application to another. In other words, there are times when data sharing is required amongst the applications, this is where the Content Providers take charge. The requests for data by the applications are handled by the methods of the ContentResolver base class. This data can be stored in the database, files, or over a network
